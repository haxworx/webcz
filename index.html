<h1>Burnt Offering at God's Temple</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p><b>Burnt offerings are not a replacment for Jesus Christ's death on the cross!</b></p>
<p>This is an experiment in mathematics and Christian spirituality. This tool will create a response of random words from the Christian Bible using both hardware entropy and the data entered by the user. Essentially this means that your offering will affect the response given.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to enter a prayer of thanksgiving to God. Your data is used instantly in the computation and not stored.</p>

<p>It's very similar to a burnt offering that the Jewish people once made at the Temple for their sins. My hope is this "oracle" might provide some help to you.</p>

<p>This is an attempt at a holy software program. Your words will affect the result and possibly (probably) your spiritual intent will affect this too. </p>

<!--Quantum-physics could be summarised simply by stating the result is a manifestation of your expectation within the bounds of the laws of the universe (including God's intercession).</p>-->

<p>I think it's very important to use your intellect in ways to honour God in interesting and unique ways.</p> 

<p>Think of new, interesting and exciting ways to praise God with your mind! Thank Him in all situations!</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by Terry A. Davis the author of TempleOS who also has schizophrenia, and this idea is borrowed from his own. Like him too I also believe that "monk logic is sound", however I don't condone much of what he says, though I respect him, his work and ideas.</p>
