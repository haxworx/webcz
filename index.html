<h1>Burnt Offering at God's Temple</h1>

<p> This tool will create a response of random words from the Christian Bible using both hardware entropy and the data entered by the user.</p>

<p>This is an attempt at a holy software program. Your words will affect the result and possibly (probably) your spiritual intent will affect this too. My suggestion is to enter a prayer of thanksgiving to God. Your data is used instantly in the computation and not stored.</p>

<form name="offering" action="./oracle.cgi" method="post" id="offering">

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>I'm intrigued by Terry A. Davis the author of TempleOS who also has schizophrenia, and this idea is borrowed from his own. Like him too I also believe that "monk logic is sound", however I don't condone much of what he says, though I respect him, his work and ideas.</p>
<p>I think it's very important to use your intellect in ways to honour God in interesting and unique ways.</p>
